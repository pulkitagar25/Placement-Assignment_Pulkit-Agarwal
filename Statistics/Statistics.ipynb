    "Step 5: Make a decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calculated t-value falls within the critical region (i.e., outside the range -2.0017 to 2.0017), we reject the null hypothesis. If it falls within the range, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Step 6: Calculate the p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also calculate the p-value associated with the t-value to determine the statistical significance. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",

    "If the p-value is less than the significance level (α), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups.\n",
